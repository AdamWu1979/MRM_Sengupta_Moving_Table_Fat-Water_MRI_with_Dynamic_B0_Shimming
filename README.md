MRM Sengupta CMT FWMRI with Dynamic B0 shimming
=============================

CMT FWMRI with Dynamic B0 Shimming is a repository for 

1. Reconstructing multiecho Golden and Linear angle, radial, continuously moving table whole body MRI scan data, 
2. Perform fat/water separations using 2 different algorithms
3. Calculate slice specific whole-body shims for dynamic shimming 

Code to download multiecho CMT MRI raw data 
from online storage, reconstruct image volumes, and reproduce 
figures presented in the journal Magnetic Resonance in Medicine
publication, *Whole-body Continuously Moving Table Fat-Water MRI with Dynamic B0 shimming at 3 Tesla*, is included.
